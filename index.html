<h1>Unity UI dev’s guide to learning Unreal 5 (v0.2)</h1>
<p>There are more similarity then difference in my experience of learning Unreal 5 when I have years of experience in Unity, 
    and I hope this premier inspires you to learn something new.</p>

<h2>Where to start</h2>

<p>“Your First Hour in UMG” is the best beginner UMG(Unreal Motion Graphic) tutorial that I found. 
    The tutorial comes with a project already setup, and it provides a good starting point to learn how UI is displayed in Unreal.</p>

<p>
    Unreal 4 and Unreal 5 has minor differences in UI, but not too many to make what you learn here hard to translate to Unreal 5. 
    This tutorial gives you the confidence to tackle other Unreal UI learnings.
</p>

<h3>Key take-aways from this tutorial:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Learn how to make a UI widget and use the Level Blueprint to add the widget to viewport, so that you can make changes in the widget and see the changes you made in the game.</li>
    <li>See how UI is updated in real time when the game runs.</li>
    <li>Gain confidence in doing stuff in the Unreal editor.</li>
  </ul>
